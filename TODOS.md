# ToDos

The actual shape of project is the very basic one as this is just an early prototype and kind of proof-of-concept. It lacks of many features and cool functions. So if you think you are able and willing to help.. :)

## Hardware

1. Remove memory limitation - add external RAM. The ATxmega128A3U **does not** have EBI onboard, unfortunatelly.

## Software

1. Improve handling zaks starting from various addresses, not only $1000
1. Implement illegal opcodes into emulator

## Both

1. Better UI
	- add some LCD display
	- add ability to load new zak in runtime (no re-build needed) - maybe Android app + BT transmission?
